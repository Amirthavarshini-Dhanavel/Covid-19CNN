# Covid-19CNN
This project is about construction of a basic CNN using Keras for the detection of COVID-19 Pneumonia from chest X-ray images. This trained model is integrated using Flask API into a web app developed using JQuery, JavaScript that detects COVID-19 when providing a chest x-ray image of a patient.
